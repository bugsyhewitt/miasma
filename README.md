# miasma

A lightweight, plugin-driven verifier of high-confidence vulnerabilities for
**bug-bounty recon-to-verification handoff**.

`miasma` is not another network scanner — `nmap`, `masscan`, OpenVAS, and
Nessus already own that space. Instead, `miasma`:

- takes a single host (e.g. output from a recon tool like `unearth`),
- fingerprints it with the system `nmap`,
- runs **benign verification probes** for the specific CVEs you care about,
- emits per-host JSON findings with vuln ID, confidence, and reproduction
  evidence.

Each probe is a small, auditable Python file. Linux-native — no JVM, no Docker.

## System dependencies

`miasma`'s recon phase shells out to `nmap` via the shared
[`nmap-wrapper`](https://github.com/bugsyhewitt/nmap-wrapper) library (installed
automatically as a dependency). **`nmap` itself is not pip-installable** —
install it with your system package manager first:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install nmap

# Arch
sudo pacman -S nmap

# Fedora
sudo dnf install nmap

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install nmap
```

Verify it's on your `PATH`:

```bash
nmap --version
```

> Note: the test suite mocks the `nmap` layer, so tests pass even without
> `nmap` installed. You only need `nmap` to run a real recon scan.

## Install

Requires Python 3.13+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bugsyhewitt/miasma
cd miasma
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Fingerprint a host and run the bundled test plugin (always reports a finding —
useful for verifying your install end to end):

```bash
miasma --target 127.0.0.1 --port-range 1-1000 --plugins test_always_finds
```

Run the real Tomcat default-credentials check (CVE-2009-3548):

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2009_3548
```

Run several plugins at once (comma-separated) and see available plugins:

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --plugins test_always_finds,cve_2009_3548
miasma --list-plugins
```

Write the JSON report to a file (for piping into downstream tooling) instead of
stdout with `--output-file`. Use `-` to force stdout (the default):

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --plugins cve_2009_3548 --output-file findings.json
```

When you request several plugins, run their probes in parallel with
`--concurrency`. Each probe is an I/O-bound network round-trip that mostly
waits, so concurrency cuts wall time roughly in proportion to how many plugins
overlap. The default is `1` (sequential). Findings are always emitted in the
**requested plugin order** regardless of how many threads run, so the JSON
report is byte-for-byte deterministic — concurrency changes only the timing:

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 \
  --plugins miasma_redis_001,miasma_elastic_001,cve_2024_23897,miasma_actuator_001 \
  --concurrency 4
```

Output is JSON:

```json
{
  "target": "127.0.0.1",
  "port_range": "1-1000",
  "open_ports": [22, 8080],
  "plugins": ["test_always_finds"],
  "findings": [
    {
      "vuln_id": "MIASMA-TEST-0001",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "confidence": "high",
      "evidence": { "note": "test plugin always reports a finding", "open_ports": [22, 8080] },
      "description": "Verification plugin that unconditionally reports a finding."
    }
  ]
}
```

### CLI options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--target` | Host to scan and probe (IP or hostname). |
| `--plugins` | Comma-separated plugin names (file stems under `miasma/plugins`). |
| `--port-range` | nmap port spec for the recon phase (default `1-1000`). |
| `--concurrency` | Run up to N plugin probes in parallel (default `1`, sequential). Findings stay in requested order regardless of N. |
| `--format` | Output format (`json`, default). |
| `--output-file` | Write the JSON report to this path instead of stdout (`-` = stdout). |
| `--list-plugins` | List available plugins and exit. |

## Writing a plugin

A plugin is **one Python file** in `miasma/plugins/<cve-id>.py` exposing a
module-level `metadata: dict` and a `probe(target: Target) -> Finding | None`
function. Return a `Finding` if the target is vulnerable, or `None` if not.

```python
# miasma/plugins/cve_2024_12345.py
from miasma.core import Finding, Target

metadata = {
    "vuln_id": "CVE-2024-12345",
    "name": "Example service auth bypass",
    "description": "Reports a finding when /admin returns 200 without auth.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12345"],
    # Optional targeting hints — see "Targeting hints" below.
    "port_hint": [8080, 8443],
    "service_hint": ["http", "https"],
}


def probe(target: Target) -> Finding | None:
    import httpx

    for port in target.open_ports():
        url = f"http://{target.host}:{port}/admin"
        try:
            resp = httpx.get(url, timeout=5.0)
        except httpx.HTTPError:
            continue
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            return Finding(
                vuln_id=metadata["vuln_id"],
                host=target.host,
                confidence=metadata["confidence"],
                evidence={"url": url, "status_code": resp.status_code},
                description=metadata["description"],
            )
    return None
```

Drop the file in `miasma/plugins/`, then run it:

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --plugins cve_2024_12345
```

> Plugin filenames use underscores (`cve_2024_12345.py`) because the runner
> discovers plugins via Python's import system, and module names can't contain
> hyphens. The canonical CVE id lives in `metadata["vuln_id"]`.

Keep probes **benign**: read-only verification, no exploitation, no state
change. The goal is high-confidence "this is real" evidence for a human to
confirm — not a weaponized exploit.

### Targeting hints (`port_hint` / `service_hint`)

Two optional metadata fields let the runner **skip plugins that obviously
can't match** a target, cutting wasted network round-trips:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `port_hint` | `list[int]` | Ports this plugin cares about (e.g. `[6379, 6380]` for Redis). |
| `service_hint` | `list[str]` | nmap service-name substrings this plugin cares about (e.g. `["redis"]`, `["http", "https"]`). |

A plugin is **skipped** for a target only when *all* of these hold, so a real
finding is never silently dropped:

1. recon found at least one open port (if recon found nothing, the plugin
   always runs and falls back to its own default-port ordering), **and**
2. the plugin declares at least one of `port_hint` / `service_hint`, **and**
3. none of the open ports match a declared `port_hint`, **and**
4. none of the open ports' nmap service names contain a declared
   `service_hint` (case-insensitive substring match).

A plugin that declares neither hint always runs (it opts out of filtering —
this is how `test_always_finds` behaves). `port_hint` is the canonical field;
`default_ports` is accepted as a backwards-compatible alias for plugins that
predate the convention.

This means a Redis plugin won't probe an SSH-only host, but a Redis instance
listening on a non-standard port still gets caught as long as nmap fingerprints
its service name as `redis`.

## Bundled plugins

| Plugin | Vuln ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `test_always_finds` | `MIASMA-TEST-0001` | Canonical test plugin — always returns a finding. |
| `cve_2009_3548` | `CVE-2009-3548` | Apache Tomcat default/weak manager credentials. |
| `miasma_actuator_001` | `MIASMA-ACTUATOR-001` | Exposed Spring Boot Actuator management endpoints (env/secret leak, heap dump). |
| `miasma_redis_001` | `MIASMA-REDIS-001` | Redis reachable without authentication (PING/INFO handshake). |
| `cve_2024_23897` | `CVE-2024-23897` | Jenkins CLI unauthenticated arbitrary file read (args4j `@file` expansion). |
| `cve_2025_55752` | `CVE-2025-55752` | Apache Tomcat Rewrite Valve path traversal into `/WEB-INF/` (web.xml disclosure). |
| `cve_2025_64446` | `CVE-2025-64446` | Fortinet FortiWeb authentication bypass via API path traversal (CISA KEV). |
| `miasma_git_001` | `MIASMA-GIT-001` | Exposed `.git/` directory (source code, commit history, committed secrets). |
| `miasma_env_001` | `MIASMA-ENV-001` | Exposed `.env` file (database URLs, cloud keys, API keys, app secrets). |
| `cve_2025_41243` | `CVE-2025-41243` | Spring Cloud Gateway exposed actuator (`/actuator/gateway/routes`) — mutable route table enables SpEL/env injection. |
| `cve_2025_61666` | `CVE-2025-61666` | Traccar (Windows) unauthenticated LFI via the override servlet — reads `conf/traccar.xml` (DB credentials). |
| `cve_2025_34028` | `CVE-2025-34028` | Commvault Command Center pre-auth SSRF→RCE — version-fingerprint of the affected 11.38 Innovation Release (CISA KEV). |
| `cve_2025_32975` | `CVE-2025-32975` | Quest KACE SMA unauthenticated authentication bypass — version-fingerprint of builds below the fixed 14.1 line (CISA KEV, CVSS 10.0). |

### MIASMA-ACTUATOR-001 — Spring Boot Actuator exposure

Probes for unauthenticated Spring Boot `/actuator/*` management endpoints,
which can leak environment variables, credentials, configuration, and a
downloadable heap dump. The probe is benign and read-only:

1. `GET /actuator/health` — lowest-risk baseline; confirms a Spring Boot app.
2. `GET /actuator` — confirms the management base is reachable.
3. `GET /actuator/env` — the sensitive endpoint (environment variables).
4. `GET /actuator/heapdump` — **header-only** check; the body is never
   downloaded, only `Content-Type` / `Content-Length` are inspected.

Severity:

- **high** — `/actuator/env` returns `200` with JSON keys that look like
  secrets (`password`, `secret`, `key`, `token`, `credential`).
- **medium** — the management surface is reachable but no recognised secrets
  are exposed (env reachable without secrets, or `/actuator` reachable while
  `/actuator/env` is blocked) — partial exposure still worth reporting.

Default management ports: `80, 443, 8080, 8443, 8090, 9090`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins miasma_actuator_001
```

### MIASMA-REDIS-001 — Redis unauthenticated access

Probes for a Redis instance reachable without authentication. Unauthenticated
Redis grants full read/write access to every key and also gates the
CVE-2025-49844 ("RediShell", CVSS 10.0) Lua use-after-free RCE chain on affected
builds. The probe speaks the Redis inline protocol over a raw TCP socket and is
benign and read-only:

1. Connect to a candidate port and send `PING\r\n`.
   - `+PONG` (no auth challenge) → unauthenticated access confirmed.
   - `-NOAUTH` / `-ERR ... AUTH ...` → authentication is enforced; not vulnerable.
2. On confirmed access, send `INFO server\r\n` and parse only the
   `redis_version` line for evidence.

No keys are read, no data is written, no config is touched.

Severity:

- **high** — `PING` returns `+PONG` with no authentication challenge.

When the reported `redis_version` is `<= 8.2.1`, the finding flags
`cve_2025_49844_in_scope` and notes CVE-2025-49844 in the description.

Default ports (port hints): `6379, 6380, 16379`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.7 --port-range 1-20000 --plugins miasma_redis_001
```

### CVE-2024-23897 — Jenkins unauthenticated arbitrary file read

Probes for the Jenkins CLI arbitrary file read (CVSS 9.8, affecting Jenkins
`<= 2.441` / LTS `<= 2.426.2`). The Jenkins CLI command parser expands any
argument of the form `@<path>` into that file's contents (an args4j feature),
and the `/cli` endpoint is reachable without authentication — so an attacker can
read arbitrary files off the controller (`/etc/passwd`,
`secrets/initialAdminPassword`, credential XML). The probe is benign: it targets
only the world-readable `/etc/passwd` and reports the leaked lines as evidence —
no file is written and no secret-bearing path is read.

1. `GET /login` — fingerprint Jenkins and read the `X-Jenkins` version header.
2. Drive the CLI download/upload duplex protocol against `/cli?remoting=false`
   with the args4j-framed command `who-am-i @/etc/passwd`. The resulting CLI
   error echoes the file's first lines back.

Severity:

- **high** — the CLI leaked `/etc/passwd` content (`root:` marker present in the
  reply); the file read is confirmed.
- **medium** — the reported version is within the vulnerable range
  (weekly `<= 2.441` / LTS `<= 2.426.2`) but the CLI file-read could not be
  confirmed on this probe (hardened, filtered, or endpoint changed) — worth a
  manual check.

Default ports (port hints): `8080, 80, 443, 8090`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.9 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2024_23897
```

### CVE-2025-55752 — Apache Tomcat Rewrite Valve path traversal

Probes for the Tomcat path traversal that becomes reachable when the Rewrite
Valve (`rewrite.config`) is configured. A crafted, rewrite-decoded path slips
past Tomcat's security constraints and reaches the normally-protected
`/WEB-INF/` directory, whose `web.xml` deployment descriptor routinely carries
JDBC/database credentials, JNDI resources, and application secrets. The probe is
benign and read-only — it only *attempts to read* the inert `WEB-INF/web.xml`
descriptor; nothing is written and no state changes.

1. `GET /` — fingerprint Tomcat via the `Server` header (`Apache-Coyote`/`Tomcat`).
2. `GET <traversal>/WEB-INF/web.xml` — a small ordered set of well-known
   traversal shapes. A normal request returns `403`/`404`; a `200` whose body
   contains the `<web-app` descriptor marker confirms the traversal read.

Severity:

- **high** — the protected `WEB-INF/web.xml` was returned (`200` with a
  `<web-app` marker); the path-traversal read is confirmed.
- **medium** — the host fingerprints as Tomcat and a normally-protected path
  returned a non-`403`/`404` status, but the descriptor read was not confirmed
  on this probe (hardened, partially exposed, or behind a different layout) —
  worth a manual check.

A non-Tomcat host is never flagged, even if it answers oddly, to avoid false
positives. Default ports (port hints): `8080, 8443, 80, 443`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2025_55752
```

### CVE-2025-64446 — Fortinet FortiWeb authentication bypass

Probes for the FortiWeb (Fortinet WAF appliance) authentication bypass added to
the CISA KEV catalog in November 2025 (active exploitation observed from October
2025). A request prefixed with a *valid* API path (`/api/v2.0/cmdb/…`) and then
traversed back down to a privileged CGI handler is authorised against the
harmless prefix the router sees first, but the dot-segments silently re-target it
at an administrative endpoint — yielding unauthenticated admin access. The probe
is benign and read-only — it only *reads* the inert `system/status` endpoint and
performs no privileged action (no user creation, no config write):

1. `GET /` and `GET /login` — fingerprint FortiWeb via the `Server`/`Set-Cookie`
   headers and the login page markers.
2. `GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/status` — the *direct* authenticated endpoint,
   which a sane appliance refuses (`401`/`403`) without a session. This is the
   control.
3. `GET <traversal>/system/status` — the same status data reached through a
   traversal-crafted path. A `200` carrying status JSON (`serial`/`version`/
   `build` markers) while the direct path refused confirms the bypass.

Severity:

- **high** — FortiWeb fingerprinted, the traversal path returned privileged
  status data (`200` + status markers), and the direct path refused (`401`/
  `403`). The auth bypass is confirmed read-only.
- **medium** — the host fingerprints as FortiWeb but the bypass was not cleanly
  confirmed (traversal answered `200` without status markers, or the direct path
  did not refuse) — worth a manual check.

A non-FortiWeb host is never flagged, even if it answers oddly, to avoid false
positives. Default ports (port hints): `443, 80, 8443`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2025_64446
```

### MIASMA-GIT-001 — Exposed `.git` directory

Probes for a web server that serves its `.git/` directory. When `.git/` is
reachable, an attacker can reconstruct the entire repository offline — full
source code, complete commit history, and any secrets (API keys, database
credentials, `.env` files) that were ever committed, even if later removed.
Consistently a P1/P2 bug-bounty finding; it's a misconfiguration (usually a
`git clone` into the web root), not a discrete CVE. The probe is benign and
read-only — it fetches two small, inert metadata files and never dumps objects
or reconstructs history:

1. `GET /.git/HEAD` — a genuine `.git/HEAD` is a one-line symbolic ref
   (`ref: refs/heads/<branch>`) or a raw 40-hex SHA for a detached HEAD. A
   server that returns its SPA `index.html` for every path is **not** flagged.
2. `GET /.git/config` — if the remote URL embeds credentials
   (`://user:pass@host`), that is flagged; the password is **redacted**
   (`://user:***@`) so the report never persists the leaked secret verbatim.

Severity:

- **high** — `/.git/HEAD` returns `200` with a valid Git ref; the exposed `.git`
  directory is confirmed. If `/.git/config` also leaks a credential-bearing
  remote URL, the finding evidence flags it (redacted).

Redirects are not followed: an exposed `.git/HEAD` is served as a static file,
so a redirect to a login page or SPA route means the dotfile is not directly
served and is not flagged. Default ports (port hints): `80, 443, 8080, 8443`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins miasma_git_001
```

### MIASMA-ENV-001 — Exposed `.env` file

Probes for a web server that serves its application `.env` file. A served `.env`
leaks the application's most concentrated bundle of secrets — `DATABASE_URL`,
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, API keys, JWT/app signing secrets, SMTP credentials —
and is among the most common high-impact bug-bounty findings, routinely caused
by misconfigured Laravel, Node.js, and Django deployments that serve the project
root statically. It's a misconfiguration, not a discrete CVE. The probe is benign
and read-only — it fetches a small, inert file at a handful of well-known dotenv
locations and never writes anything:

1. `GET /.env` — the canonical location.
2. `GET /.env.production`, `GET /.env.local`, `GET /.env.dev` — Laravel/Node
   environment-specific variants, checked when `/.env` is absent.

A `200` whose body parses as dotenv content (`KEY=value` assignment lines)
confirms exposure. A server that returns its SPA `index.html` for every path is
**not** flagged (HTML has no `KEY=` lines).

Severity:

- **high** — the served file parses as dotenv content **and** at least one key
  name looks secret-bearing (`SECRET`/`PASSWORD`/`TOKEN`/`API_KEY`/`ACCESS_KEY`/
  `DATABASE_URL`/`DSN`/…). A live `.env` with real secrets is confirmed.
- **medium** — the served file parses as dotenv content but exposes only config
  keys (no recognised secret-bearing key) — still an information-disclosure
  misconfiguration worth a manual look.

The leaked secret *values* are never persisted: evidence records only the
exposed key *names*, so the report flags the exposure without storing the
secrets verbatim. Redirects are not followed (the dotfile must be served
directly). Default ports (port hints): `80, 443, 8080, 8443`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins miasma_env_001
```

### CVE-2025-41243 — Spring Cloud Gateway exposed actuator

Probes for a Spring Cloud Gateway whose actuator `gateway` endpoints are exposed
without authentication. Spring Cloud Gateway exposes `/actuator/gateway/*` to let
operators inspect and **mutate** the routing table at runtime. When those
endpoints are unauthenticated, an attacker can POST a new route carrying a Spring
Expression Language (SpEL) payload in a filter; on the next request through that
route the SpEL is evaluated, exfiltrating environment variables, credentials, and
API keys (or achieving RCE). The probe is benign and read-only — it **never**
POSTs, modifies a route, or injects an expression. It only confirms the surface
is reachable without auth:

1. `GET /actuator/gateway/routes` — the route table (a JSON array). A `200`
   serving an array confirms the mutable route surface is exposed.
2. `GET /actuator/gateway` — the gateway actuator base (fallback). A `200` JSON
   object listing gateway sub-endpoints is partial confirmation.

A server that returns its SPA `index.html` for every path is **not** flagged
(HTML doesn't parse as JSON), and a JSON *object* at the routes path is not
treated as a route table.

Severity:

- **high** — `/actuator/gateway/routes` returns `200` with a JSON array (the
  route table). The mutate-able route surface is confirmed exposed.
- **medium** — the route table is not cleanly served but the gateway actuator
  base `/actuator/gateway` returns `200` JSON (surface present, route table not
  confirmed).

Evidence records only the route count and route *ids* (operator-chosen labels,
not secrets) so a human can confirm the table is real without us touching it.
Redirects are not followed (a redirect to a login page means the surface is not
unauthenticated). Default ports (port hints): `8080, 8443, 80, 443`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2025_41243
```

### CVE-2025-61666 — Traccar unauthenticated LFI (Windows)

Probes for the Traccar (open-source GPS fleet tracking) local file inclusion on
Windows. Traccar's default install exposes a `DefaultOverrideServlet` without
authentication; on Windows a path-normalisation failure lets an encoded traversal
escape the override root and read arbitrary files. The crown jewel is
`conf/traccar.xml` — the main config — which holds the database JDBC URL and
credentials. Affected: Traccar 6.1 – 6.8.1 on Windows. The probe is benign and
read-only — it only *reads* the inert config file, writing nothing:

1. `GET /api/server` — Traccar's unauthenticated server-info JSON. A clean 200
   carrying Traccar-specific keys (`deviceReadonly`, `mapUrl`, `bingKey`, …) is
   the primary fingerprint; the root page body is a secondary check.
2. `GET /conf/traccar.xml` — the LFI target requested **directly**. On a sane
   install this is not web-servable (`404`/`403`); that refusal is the control.
3. `GET <override-traversal>` — the same `conf/traccar.xml` reached through the
   override-servlet traversal. A `200` whose body is the Traccar properties-XML
   config while the direct path refused confirms the LFI.

A non-Traccar host is **never** flagged, even if it answers oddly, to avoid false
positives. An SPA `index.html` returned for the traversal path is not the config
(no properties-XML markers) and is not flagged. Redirects are not followed.

Severity:

- **high** — Traccar fingerprinted, the override traversal returned the
  `conf/traccar.xml` config (`200` + properties-XML markers) that the direct path
  refused (`404`/`403`). The LFI read is confirmed.
- **medium** — the host fingerprints as Traccar but the LFI was not cleanly
  confirmed (patched, non-Windows, filtered, or the direct path did not refuse) —
  a candidate worth a manual check.

The leaked secret **values** are never persisted — evidence records only the
config *key names* present (e.g. `database.password`) plus a `secret_keys_present`
flag, mirroring the redaction convention of the `.env` and `.git` plugins. Default
ports (port hints): `8082, 80, 443`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2025_61666
```

### CVE-2025-34028 — Commvault Command Center pre-auth SSRF / RCE

Fingerprints Commvault Command Center — the web console for the widely deployed
Commvault enterprise backup suite — and flags the affected **11.38 Innovation
Release** line, which exposes `/deployWebpackage.do` without authentication and
chains to server-side request forgery and pre-auth remote code execution. Backup
appliances are crown-jewel ransomware targets, so the CVE is on CISA's KEV
catalog.

This probe is **version-fingerprint only** and never touches the vulnerable
endpoint — triggering `/deployWebpackage.do` is an active exploitation step and is
deliberately out of scope. The flow is benign and read-only:

1. `GET /commandcenter/` (then `/webconsole/`, `/commandcenter/login`, `/`) —
   fingerprint Command Center via the login-page body, the `Server` header, and
   `cv_*` login cookies. The first path that fingerprints wins for that port.
2. Read the advertised build string — Command Center exposes its release as a
   dotted `11.38` / `11.38.x` or an `SP38` service-pack tag on the login page. The
   `11.38` line is the affected window.

A non-Commvault host is **never** flagged, even if it coincidentally mentions a
`11.38`-ish string. A Commvault host on a known-safe release (e.g. `11.36`) is a
clean negative, not a candidate. Redirects are not followed.

Severity:

- **high** — Commvault Command Center fingerprinted **and** an affected `11.38`
  Innovation Release version string is present. The pre-auth SSRF→RCE surface is
  exposed; flag for an operator-driven active check (which miasma does not run).
- **medium** — Command Center fingerprinted but **no** version string could be
  read (hardened login page or stripped banner) — worth a manual version check.

The vulnerable `/deployWebpackage.do` endpoint is **never** contacted and no
credentials are submitted; evidence records only the fingerprint path, `Server`
header, and the version string read from the public login page. Default ports
(port hints): `443, 80, 8443`.

### CVE-2025-32975 — Quest KACE SMA authentication bypass

Fingerprints Quest KACE SMA (Systems Management Appliance) — an enterprise IT
endpoint-management appliance that pushes software and patches to managed hosts —
and flags builds below the fixed **14.1** line (the March 2025 patch). Those
versions carry an authentication bypass (CVSS 10.0) that hands an attacker a full
administrator session without credentials, making a hijacked console a fleet-wide
foothold. The CVE is on CISA's KEV catalog with confirmed in-the-wild
exploitation.

This probe is **version-fingerprint only** and never attempts the bypass —
performing it is an active exploitation step and is deliberately out of scope. The
flow is benign and read-only:

1. `GET /userui/login.php` (then `/userui/`, `/adminui/login.php`, `/`) —
   fingerprint KACE via the login-page body, the `X-KACE-*` headers, and the
   `kboxid` login cookie. The first path that fingerprints wins for that port.
2. Read the advertised build — KACE exposes a dotted `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` string
   in an `X-KACE-Version` header or on the login page. Anything below `14.1` is
   the affected window; `14.1` and above is fixed.

A non-KACE host is **never** flagged, even if it coincidentally mentions a
`14.0`-ish string. A KACE host on a fixed release (`14.1`+) is a clean negative,
not a candidate. Redirects are not followed.

Severity:

- **high** — KACE SMA fingerprinted **and** an affected version (below `14.1`) is
  present. The unauthenticated admin-takeover surface is exposed; flag for an
  operator-driven active check (which miasma does not run).
- **medium** — KACE SMA fingerprinted but **no** version string could be read
  (hardened login page or stripped banner) — worth a manual version check.

The authentication bypass is **never** attempted and no credentials are
submitted; evidence records only the fingerprint path, `Server` header, and the
version string read from the public login page. Default ports (port hints):
`443, 80`.

```bash
miasma --target 10.0.0.5 --port-range 1-10000 --plugins cve_2025_32975
```

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

The test suite mocks `nmap` at the shared `nmap-wrapper` seam
(`nmap_wrapper.scanner._new_scanner`), so it's green on systems without `nmap`
installed.
